			OPP Explorer is being co-designed with science, regulatory and the OPP Design and Prototype teams. The key to designing easy-to-use software tools is to deeply understand the people who use them and their jobs. This practice and associated methods is called Human Centered Design (User Centered Design, User Experience (UX) design). It is a way to have more productive meetings to understand a groupâ€™s priorities, get more clarity on how things work now or generate many new ideas to solve a stubborn problem.
